> Definition :  Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Problems to Solve

- Constructing objects with different representations : This means what a class can create an object which is configured in a different way but it conserves the same nature.
- Configure or create complex objects in an easy way : Some objects may need a lot of information to be created, and not all representations needs all the data, and if you don't use a pattern you can fall in twenty constructor or an optional parameter hell.
